# 🌱 Smart Fertilizer Recommendation System

The **Smart Fertilizer Recommendation System** is an intelligent and user-friendly web application designed to help farmers choose the most suitable fertilizer for their crops. It takes into account various environmental and soil conditions to promote sustainable agriculture.

Many small-scale farmers still depend on harmful chemical fertilizers and lack access to modern farming tools or proper guidance. This system aims to bridge that gap by offering precise, data-driven recommendations to improve crop quality and soil health.
